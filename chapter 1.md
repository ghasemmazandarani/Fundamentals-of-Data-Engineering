# Everything I Learned from the First Chapter of the Book "Fundamentals of Data Engineering"

## Understanding Data Engineering

There's a lot of confusion about what data engineering means and what data engineers do. This section explores various definitions and perspectives on the field of data engineering.

## Definitions of Data Engineering by Others

1. **Data Infrastructure Setup and Maintenance**  
   Data engineering involves creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information. Dedicated data engineers maintain data availability and usability, setting up and operating an organization's data infrastructure to prepare it for further analysis.

2. **Types of Data Engineering: SQL-Focused and Big Data-Focused**  
   - **SQL-Focused Data Engineering**: Centers on relational databases where SQL (or a SQL-based language) is the main tool for data processing, often aided by ETL tools.
   - **Big Data-Focused Data Engineering**: Relies on Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Cassandra, and HBase, with data processing done in frameworks like MapReduce, Spark, and Flink, and programming languages like Java, Scala, and Python.

3. **Data Movement, Manipulation, and Management**  
   Data engineering revolves around the movement, manipulation, and management of data.

## Book's Definition of Data Engineering

According to the book, data engineering encompasses the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems that transform raw data into high-quality, consistent information for downstream use cases, including analysis and machine learning. This discipline intersects with security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

## The Data Engineering Lifecycle

An obvious pattern emerges in data engineering: obtaining data, storing it, and preparing it for use by data scientists, analysts, and others. The main stages of the data engineering lifecycle include:

- **Generation**
- **Storage**
- **Ingestion**
- **Transformation**
- **Serving**

### Lifecycle Undercurrents

Critical ideas that span the lifecycle—referred to as "undercurrents"—include security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

## The Roots of Data Engineering

The origins of data engineering can arguably be traced back to data warehousing, marking its distinction from data science and analytics. While data engineering and data science complement each other, they have unique roles: data engineers provide the inputs used by data scientists to create valuable insights.

## The Essential Skills of a Data Engineer

A data engineer’s skill set encompasses the "undercurrents" of data engineering—security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, and software engineering. Data engineers must evaluate data tools, understand data production in source systems, and know how analysts and data scientists will utilize the data post-processing.

## The Modern Role of Data Engineers

Today, data engineers focus on balancing simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and best-of-breed services to bring business value. They are also responsible for creating agile data architectures that adapt to emerging trends.

## What Data Engineers Do Not Do

While data engineers need a functional understanding of adjacent fields, they typically do not directly:

- Build ML models
- Create reports or dashboards
- Perform data analysis
- Build KPIs
- Develop software applications
